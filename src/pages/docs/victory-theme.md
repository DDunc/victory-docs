# VictoryTheme

Implement themes for your Victory charts. `VictoryTheme` allows you to create a consistent look across all of your chart elements, either by using one of the included themes or by creating your own. `VictoryTheme` and custom themes are supported by all Victory components. By default, Victory components use the [grayscale theme].
